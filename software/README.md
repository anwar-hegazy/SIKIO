Drop the _sikio_ folder into the _libraries_ directory in your main Processing sketchbook location. Open Processing, enable Android mode, and you should be able to import the sikio library. 

This file is the compressed IOIO library for use in Processing. It is created by compressing the main IOIO library (IOIOLib) into a jar file.  

Currently, the only known working IOIO lib with Processing is anything less than app v0330. The one we are using is from v0326. See the complete list of IOIO application software [here](https://github.com/ytai/ioio/tree/master/release/software).
