This file is the compressed IOIO library for use in Processing. It is created by compressing the main IOIO library (IOIOLib) into a jar file. The jar file can sit in the _libraries_ directory in the Processing sketchbook location. 

Drop the _sikio_ folder into the _libraries_ directory in your main Processing sketchbook location. Open Processing, enable Android mode, and you should be able to import the sikio library. 

Currently, the only known working IOIO lib with Processing is anything less than app v3.22. The one we are using is from v3.11. See the complete list of IOIO application software [here](https://github.com/ytai/ioio/tree/master/release/software).
